This template is for a tutorial that covers a concept. Concepts provide a high-level overview to a new topic, and answer questions like "why?" and "when?".

To use it, copy it into your page's directory and rename it to "index.md". Example: src/documentation/0029-node-event-loop/index.md. Follow the instructions contained within comments. And replace, or review, placeholder text. Before submitting the final draft remove all the extra comments from the file.

The general format for all tutorials is:

1. Introduction: Introduce the topic, tell the reader what you're going to tell them and why it's important.
2. Body: Explain the topic or concept in detail.
3. Conclusion: Review what you just said. Highlight 2-3 key points the reader should take away.

Titles for concept tutorials should be in the form of a question. e.g.) "Why use NPM?", or "What is the V8 JavaScript Engine". Or, indicate that the document provides an overview of a topic. e.g.) "An Overview of the V8 JavaScript Engine".

Change the title in the frontmatter above.

<!--
The introduction should consist of a short summary of what will be covered in this tutorial. Someone should be able to read this, and the following bullet list, and know if they want to proceed with the rest of the page or not.

Add a bullet list in "students will be able to" format, e.g.:

Upon completing this tutorial you'll be able to:

- Explain what the V8 JavaScript engine is
- Understand the relationships between V8 and Node.js
- List alternatives to the V8 engine and scenarios in which you might use them
