This template is for a tutorial that covers a task. Tasks provide specific step-by-step instructions to achieve a goal and answer questions like "how?".

To use it, copy it into your page's directory and rename it to "index.md". Example: src/documentation/0029-node-event-loop/index.md. Follow the instructions contained within comments. And replace, or review, placeholder text. Before submitting the final draft remove all the extra comments from the file.

The general format for all tutorials is:

1. Introduction: Introduce the task, tell the reader what you're going to tell them and what they'll be able to do once they complete the tutorial.
2. Body: Explain the task in detail and provide specific step-by-step instructions.
3. Conclusion: Review what you just said. Highlight 2-3 key points the reader should take away.

Titles for task tutorials should be in the format "Verbing a Noun". e.g. "Build an HTTP Server" or "Install an NPM Package".

Change the title in the frontmatter above.
-->

<!--
The introduction should consist of a short summary of what will be covered in this tutorial. Someone should be able to read this, and the following bullet list, and know if they want to proceed with the rest of the page or not.

Add a bullet list in "students will be able to" format, e.g.:

Upon completing this tutorial you'll be able to:

- Use npm to install one or more packages
- Install a specific version of a package
- Find additional help for the `npm install` command

> Introduction.

## Goal
<!--

The main body of the tutorial goes here. This is where you describe the actual steps required to achieve the goal. Be specific, not generic, when possible.

If the task involves a UI, for example filling out a form, include screen shots.

This section should end with something that helps the reader verify they have correctly completed the task. Include a screen shot where appropriate.

Note: any included screenshots for your article should be saved in the same directory your article.md file lives in.

e.g.:
![Don't forget an alt tag](./screenshot-1.png)
